        <h2>How I created this website</h2>
        <p>I tried to make the website in Github as its mostly used and I already had an account.</p>
        <p>I edited my code in Visual Studio Code and tested the website in Chrome. Since it's my first time programming, I needed to take a look at references from The MDN Web Docs quite a lot. Even though the codes where given, I was struggling in the beginning to understand how Github and VS Code work. Therefore, I ended up spending some time googling on which buttons do what.</p>
        <p>After I created the main, about and project management pages, I added the contents in VS Code using the lecture slides and demonstrations. I wrote the contents in HTML and tried to add some style at About page with CSS. Then, I added images to make the website more visually appealing.</p>
        <p>Finally, I tested the website and before uplaoding it into Github. Making the website online or available was bit challenging since it was not a straghtforword process. However, with help of Youtube tutorials, my website became online.</p>
        <p> Yay</p>
