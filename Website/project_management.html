        <h2>How I created this website</h2>
        <p>I tried to make the website in Github as its mostly used and I already had an account.</p>
        <p>I edited my code in Visual Studio Code and tested the website in Chrome. Since it's my first time programming, I needed to take a look at references from The MDN Web Docs quite a lot. Even though the codes where given, I was struggling in the beginning to understand how Github and VS Code work. Therefore, I ended up spending some time googling on which buttons do what.</p>
        <p>Finally, I wrote the neccessary code and tested it before uplaoding it into Github.</p>
