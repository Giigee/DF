        <h2>Different media file types</h2>
        <p>There are so many different media formats exist varying in their encoding and decoding mechanisms. Some formats are smaller and load faster, while others offer higher quality but are larger, making it difficult to navigate and unitlize. Images usually on the web mainly come in JPEG, PNG and WebP, while videos come in MP4 and WebM formats, each with varying qualities and compression. Source code files (HTML, CSS) are often hosted in repositories or as downloadable ZIP files for project sharing. Documents like PDF, DOCX, and TXT are widely used for structured content, reports, and manuals. The choice of file type depends on balancing quality, compatibility, and loading speed, ensuring optimal performance for different devices and network conditions.</p>

        <h2>Image cropping, resizing and compression</h2>
        <p>Images are edited to optimize file size, improve quality, enhance visual appeal, and ensure compatibility with different devices. Cropping removes unnecessary parts of an image while reducing file size. Resizing adjusts the image dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio. Compressing reduces file size. For example, JPEG uses lossy compression which reduces file size and quality, PNG uses lossless compression to preserve full detail and WebP offers a balance between quality and file size efficiency.

        <p>I sourced the images are from the free platform canva.com and enhanced the crystal element. Using Appleâ€™s Preview app, I resized and compressed the image to ensure it remains under 500kB with a maximum dimension of 1920px.

        <h2>Video capture, cutting, resizing and compression </h2>
        <p>Web videos need optimization to ensure smooth streaming and quick loading times. Video capture involves recording footage using a camera or a recording software. Cutting trims unnecessary sections to reduce duration or file size. Resizing adjusts video resolution and compression reduces file size. To reduce the file size further, removal of audio or reducing frame rate can be done.</p>
        <p>The video below is obtained from the free resource Pexels.com and edited using DaVinci Resolve. I rotated the footage, adjusted the aspect ratio to HD resolution (1280x720px), and compressed it to keep the file size under 2MB. Video is autoplaying, looping, and muted to enhance user experience.
