        <h2>Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing</h2>
        <p>Additive manufacturing, or knows as 3D printing, is a process of producing three-dimentional object from digital design. Traditionally, people used subractive manufacturing to create three-dimentional objects by removing materials. Compared to this subractive manufacturing, additive manufacturing allows complex geometries while reducing material waste. Nowadays, 3D printing is utilized in various industries including consumer products, buildings and healthcare. There are differefent 3D printing technologies such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), with varying applications and precisions. FDM is widely used for prototyping due to its affordability, while SLA is used for models requiring high detail and smooth surfaces. SLS is used for making complex parts without the support structures.  </p>

        <h2>FDM or FFF 3D printing</h2>
        <p>FDM is known as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) as well. FDM or FFM is one of the most accessible and widely used 3D printing technologies. In this technique, a model is produced by melting or softening the filament and extrusing a small stream of the filaments that hardens to form layers. .The filament can be thermoplastic, metal wire, etc. The advantages of FDM include affordibility, easy of use and material versatility. However, FDM is not ideal for parts that require small derails since FDM has relatively high layer height and the finished products has rough surface. Due to these, FDM is commonly used for fast prototyping and general use applications.  </p>

        <h2>My 3D model in FreeCAD </h2>
        <p> To create my 3D model, I followed the FreeCAD Whiffle Ball tutorial, which I believe showcases the advantages of additive manufacturing. I followed through the tutorial up to the point of creating a box with holes. I believe this model is not possible with traditional fabrication methods like laser cutting since the model has enclosed structure. After designing the model in FreeCAD, I exported it as a 3MF file and imported it into PrusaSlicer for preparation. During the lecture, we configured PrusaSlicer by selecting the appropriate printer and material settings. Unfortunalely, I couldn't make a time to print my model due to my overlapping compulsary lectures and Winter school in north Finland. </p>
