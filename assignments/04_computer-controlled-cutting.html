        <h2>Computer controlled cutting</h2>
        <p>There are various computer-controlled cutting techniques such as vinyl cutting, waterjet cutting, and laser cutting. Vinyl cutting uses a small blade to precisely cut through thin materials such as vinyl and paper. Waterjet cutting, as the name suggest, uses high-pressure water streams mixed with abrasives (sand, etc) to cut through thick materials including metal and stone. Laser cutting is one of the most precise method and it uses a high-energy laser beam to vaporize or melt materials. Laser cutting is ideal for detailed work in wood, acrylic, and fabric. Each method is selected based on material type and desired precision.</p>

        <h2>Working principles</h2>
        <p>A laser cutter works by directing a high-powered laser beam through a lens to focus it onto a material, creating a precise cut. The <b>laser waist </b> refers to the narrowest point of the laser beam, which determines cut accuracy. <b>Laser focus</b> describes the focal point where the laser beam is most effective, ensuring a clean and sharp cut. <b>Kerf</b> is the width of material removed by the laser during cutting. Understanding and considering kerf during sketching is important for designing interlocking parts, as incorrect measurements can lead to loose or overly tight fits.</p>

        <h2>Work process</h2>
        <p>To design a box with finger joints in FreeCAD, I started with the Part Design workbench, creating a base sketch and extruding it to form panels. Using the "Macro_BoxCreater" tool, I generated a box with my desired measurements and finger joints. After creating individual sketches, I assembled them in TechDraw and exported the drawing as a PDF and SVG. Before sending the file for cutting, I adjusted the line weight to 0.01mm and ensured no fill using Inkscape. Below is a screenshot from my FreeCAD process.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I created a chair design using Shaper3D on my iPad and printed it using the same parameters and process as above. Initally, I tried to create the box myself, but after spending a day on creating the box on FreeCAD, I couldn't make pockets from my sketch.</p>

        <h2>Final outcome</h2>
        <p>After preparing the design, I sent the files to the Epilog Engraver for laser cutting. Before cutting the final piece, I performed test cuts on 4mm thick cardboard to determine the best settings. After determining, I chose 20% speed, 50% power, and 50% frequency. Due to missing kerf compensation, the joints were slightly loose but still held shape. After cutting, I manually assembled the parts by fitting the finger joints together. In future iterations, I will account for kerf in my design to ensure a tighter fit. Below are screenshots of the cutting process and an image of the final assembled objects.</p>
