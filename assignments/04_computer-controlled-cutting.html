        <h2>Computer controlled cutting</h2>
        <p> Computer controlled cutting refers to cutting materilas with high precision using computer automated process and design. There are various computer controlled cutting techniques such as vinyl cutting, waterjet cutting, and laser cutting. <b>Vinyl cutting</b> uses a small blade to precisely cut through vinyl. Vinyl cutting is useful for making sticker which can be used on boxes, windows, walls and textiles. <b></b>Waterjet cutting </b> uses high-pressure water streams mixed with abrasives (sand, etc) to cut through thick materials including metal and stone. Waterjet cutting is preferrd when the material is sensitive to high temperature or the material is too thick. <b>Laser cutting</b> is one of the most precise method and it uses a high-energy laser beam to vaporize or melt materials to cut. Laser cutting is ideal for detailed work in wood, acrylic, and fabric. However, laser cutting cannot be used for meterals with high reflectivity (metals, glasses) and materials that can release chlorine gas when exposed to heat of the laser such as PVC (polyvinil chlorise). For reflective metals, anti-reflective coating can be applied to be used for laser cutting. As each method differs in materials used, precision and application, it is important to choose the correct method.</p>

        <h2>Working principles</h2>
        <p>Typical laser cutter's main components include laser source, laser cutting head, beam delivery system, cutter motion system. A laser cutter works by directing a high-powered laser beam through a lens to focus it onto a material, which raises the temperature of the materials rapidly and vaporizes the material to cut. The <b>laser waist </b> or beam waist refers to the width of the laser beam at its narrowest point, which determines cutting presicion and accuracy. The smaller the laser waist, the sharper and cleaner edges the cut will have. <b>Laser focus</b> is a process of adjusting the beam for optimal cutting precision. Focus point is where all the laser beam converges to laser waist. If the focus point is not alligned, the machine may not be able to cut or make bigger gaps when cutting. Therefore, its good to adjudt the focus point for every material before the cutting. <b>Kerf</b> is the width of material removed by the laser during cutting. Understanding and considering kerf during sketching is important for designing interlocking parts, as incorrect measurements can lead to loose or overly tight fits.</p>

        <h2>Work process</h2>
        <p>For this project, I wanted to design a box with finger joints. Initally, I tried to create the box myself, but after spending a day on sketching the box on FreeCAD, I couldn't make pockets from my sketch. For some reason, pockets were not appearing, even after I made sure to make all lines to be alligned or connected. Then I treid using the "Macro_BoxCreater" Macro tool and I generated a box with my desired measurements and finger joints. I assembled the sketches from all sides of the box in TechDraw and exported the drawing as a PDF and SVG. Before sending the file for cutting, I adjusted the line weight to 0.01mm and ensured no fill using Inkscape. Below is a screenshot from my FreeCAD process. </p>

        <p>Additionally, I created a chair design using Shaper3D on my iPad. Since it was an touch screen interface, it was easier for me to understand and execute different designs. Similar to TechDraw in FreeCAD, I could export the sketches from different perspectives and save it in PDF format. Finally, the chair design is printed using the same parameters and process as above. </p>

        <h2>Final outcome</h2>
        <p>After preparing the design, I sent the files to the Epilog Engraver for laser cutting. Before cutting the final piece, I cheked the laser focus and performed test cuts on 4mm thick cardboard to determine the best settings. The test shows how the material reacts in differet speed and power. I chose 20% speed, 50% power, and 50% frequency. Since I didn't consider or calculate kerf when I make the designs, the joints were slightly loose but luckily it still held in shape. This showed me that accounting for kerf is essential for achieving precise designs, especially when working with joints. In the future, I will account for the kerf during sketching to ensure a tighter fit. Below are screenshots of the cutting process and an image of the final assembled objects.</p>
