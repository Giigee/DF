        <h2>Little about me</h2>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Giiguulen Enkhsaikhan. I'm a PhD student at Aalto University. I study textiles from Man-Made Cellulosic Fibers.</p>
        <p>The reason I'm taking Digital Fabrication course is because I'm interested in 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC milling. One day, I'd like to make my own machines and robots or anyhting I want. I am excited to learn more about these technologies and how they can be used in the real world.</p>
        <p>When I'm not studying, I enjoy hiking, reading, and crocheting. In general, I like to try new sports, activities, hobbies and places. I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences with you on this webpage.</p>

        <h2>How I created this website</h2>
        <p>I tried to make the website in Github as its mostly used and I already had an account.</p>
        <p>I edited my code in Visual Studio Code and tested the website in Chrome. Since it's my first time programming, I needed to take a look at references from The MDN Web Docs quite a lot. Even though the codes where given, I was struggling in the beginning to understand how Github and VS Code work. Therefore, I ended up spending some time googling on which buttons do what.</p>
        <p>After I created the main, about and project management pages, I added the contents in VS Code using the lecture slides and demonstrations. I wrote the contents in HTML and tried to add some style at About page with CSS. Then, I added images to make the website more visually appealing.</p>
        <p>Finally, I tested the website and before uplaoding it into Github. Making the website online or available was bit challenging since it was not a straghtforword process. However, with help of Youtube tutorials, my website became online.</p>
        <p> Yay</p>
